# HTML/CSS
I took the summaries and visualizations from my WeatherPy project and included them in a website of my own design.
Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is used to add text and tables; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is there to make it all look good.
Click through the menu to view dynamic pages that adjust to several screen sizes (thanks bootstrap!).  
There is evan a hidden Easter Egg in there too for super slueths looking to leave no stone unturned.
